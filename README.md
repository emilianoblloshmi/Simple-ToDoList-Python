This is a simple Todolist python application , created only for learning , the first one is the easiest which will run on any terminal \n
The second one is the simplest one with a GUI added to it using Tkinter  \n
Third one is made with PyQt5 , the GUI on both is very basic , it was made just to show how easy is to convert python lines from a terminal display to a Gui 
for the third one to run u will need to install it 
"pip install PyQt5" \n
