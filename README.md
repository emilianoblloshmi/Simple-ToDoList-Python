# Simple ToDoList

This Simple ToDoList project is implemented in Python using different graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks: terminal interface, Tkinter, and PyQt5. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks in a to-do list.

- **Terminal Interface**: Basic to-do list functionality implemented with a simple text-based interface in the terminal.
- **Tkinter Interface**: A graphical user interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to interact with the to-do list through buttons and entry fields.
- **PyQt5 Interface**: Another graphical user interface built with PyQt5, providing a more modern and feature-rich experience for managing tasks.
